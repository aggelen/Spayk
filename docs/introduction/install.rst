============

Spayk packages are published on the `Python Package Index
<https://pypi.org/project/Spayk/>`_ (PyPI).  The preferred tool for installing
packages from PyPI is :command:`pip`, which is included in all modern versions of
Python.

Run the following command::

   To avoid issues when rebuilding your environment,
   it is advisable to pin spayk and third-party extension
